# VendingMachine

A vending machine sells items for various prices and can give change. At the start of
the day it is loaded with a certain number of coins of various denominations e.g. 100
x 1c, 50 x 5c, 50 x 10c 50 x25c etc. When an item is requested a certain number of
coins are provided. Write code that models the vending machine and calculates the
change to be given when an item is purchased (e.g. 2 x 25c used to purchase an
item costing 35c might return 1 x 10c and 1 x 5c).
